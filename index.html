        <article>
          <h3>Life</h3>
          <p>
            Nāgārjuna lived porabably somewhere in the 1st to 3th century where he was born into a Brahmin family in Vidarbha, a region of present day eastern Maharashtra, and it was only later that he became a Buddhist.Some evidence suggests him to have lived and studied a part of his live in a mixed monastry (Mahayanists and non-Mahayanists), the Amaravati Stupa in Andhra Pradesh, which was affiliatted with some Mahasamghika sub-school. As was custom for most great thinkers in history, it is thought that Nagarjuna also, served as an advisor to a king (Yajna Sri Satakarni).

          <h3>Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            Nagarjuna can be considered as one of the greatest philosophers that ever lived. For Buddhism in particular he is held in high esteem and is often called the second Buddha. He also greatly affected Hindu philosphy, and it is very likely that the 8th century Shankara's "advaita vedanta" - one of the major school if not the major school of present day Indian philosphy - had not been there or at the very leas, not in its known scriptural form if it was not for Nagarjuna. His importance did not stop there. 19th century european existentialism as well as other schools of western philophy also has been greatly influenced by the ruthless and unforgiving sharp analysis Nagarjuna had shared with the world.

            <h4>Sunyata</h4>
            <p>
              Nāgārjuna's major thematic focus is the concept of śūnyatā ("emptiness") which brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman "not-self" and pratītyasamutpāda "dependent origination", to refute the metaphysics of some of his contemporaries. For Nāgārjuna, as for the Buddha in the early texts, it is not merely sentient beings that are "selfless" or non-substantial; all phenomena (dhammas) are without any svabhāva, literally "own-being", "self-nature", or "inherent existence" and thus without any underlying essence. They are empty of being independently existent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhāva circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. This is so because all things arise always dependently: not by their own power, but by depending on conditions leading to their coming into existence, as opposed to being.
    Nāgārjuna means by real any entity which has a nature of its own (svabhāva), which is not produced by causes (akrtaka), which is not dependent on anything else (paratra nirapeksha)

            <h4>Two Truths</h4>
            <p>
              Nāgārjuna was also instrumental in the development of the two truths doctrine, which claims that there are two levels of truth in Buddhist teaching, the ultimate truth (paramārtha satya) and the conventional or superficial truth (saṃvṛtisatya). The ultimate truth to Nāgārjuna is the truth that everything is empty of essence, this includes emptiness itself ('the emptiness of emptiness').

          <div class="sub-article">
            <h4>Causality</h4>
            <p>
              Nāgārjuna distinguished two dependent origination views in a causal process, that which causes effects and that which causes conditions. This is predicated in the two truth doctrine, as conventional truth and ultimate truth held together, in which both are empty in existence. The distinction between effects and conditions is controversial. In Nāgārjuna's approach, cause means an event or state that has power to bring an effect. Conditions, refer to proliferating causes that bring a further event, state or process; without a metaphysical commitment to an occult connection between explaining and explanans. He argues nonexistent causes and various existing conditions. The argument draws from unreal causal power. Things conventional exist and are ultimately nonexistent to rest in the middle way in both causal existence and nonexistence as casual emptiness within the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā doctrine. Although seeming strange to Westerners, this is seen as an attack on a reified view of causality.

            <h4>Relativity</h4>
            <p>
              Nāgārjuna also taught the idea of relativity; in the Ratnāvalī, he gives the example that shortness exists only in relation to the idea of length. The determination of a thing or object is only possible in relation to other things or objects, especially by way of contrast. He held that the relationship between the ideas of "short" and "long" is not due to intrinsic nature (svabhāva)

          <h3>Works</h3>
          <p>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā is Nāgārjuna's best-known work. Utilizing the Buddha's theory of "dependent arising" (pratitya-samutpada), Nagarjuna demonstrated the futility of metaphysical speculations. His method of dealing with such metaphysics is referred to as "middle way" (madhyama pratipad). It is the middle way that avoided the substantialism of the Sarvastivadins as well as the nominalism of the Sautrantikas.<br>
  In the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, all experienced phenomena are empty (sunya). This did not mean that they are not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of a permanent and eternal substance (svabhava) because, like a dream, they are mere projections of human consciousness. Since these imaginary fictions are experienced, they are not mere names (prajnapti).</p>
          <p>There are many more works that can be attributed to Nagarjuna. Aside from the Mulamadhyamakarika described above, there are 5 other scripts which are by many considered to be Nagarjuna's main treatises:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Śūnyatāsaptati (Seventy Verses on Emptiness)</li>
              <li>Vigrahavyāvartanī (The End of Disputes)</li>
              <li>Vaidalyaprakaraṇa (Pulverizing the Categories)</li>
              <li>Vyavahārasiddhi (Proof of Convention)</li>
              <li>Yuktiṣāṣṭika (Sixty Verses on Reasoning)</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Understand that the earliest surviving accounts were written in Chinese and Tibetan centuries after his death. None of the original works that have been written down by Nagarjuna or his direct disciples have survived.</p>
